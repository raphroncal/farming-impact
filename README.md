# farming-impact
A Genshin Impact resource calculator. This project computes the resources necessary to level up a particular character from and to user-provided levels. Design is based from gscale (https://www.gscale.cc) by glaciyan (https://github.com/glaciyan/gscale) since I am not very good at designing. Much thanks to them.
